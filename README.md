# SNHU IT 140 Project One and Two
The projects are about a text-based game where the player types their decisions through the console window. To win the game, players should take items from the rooms to reach the end. In my game, I chose a superstore as the game's map, and players must acquire specific items and be in a particular room to win. Additionally, I decided that the game should randomly place the items throughout the map, including the enemy's location, although it was not necessary for the Project Two. Project One involves creating a map, explaining how the game will function, and developing pseudocode for moving the player between rooms and retrieving items. Project Two focuses on creating the game using Python, utilizing dictionaries to construct the map.
